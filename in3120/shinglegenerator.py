    """
    Does character-level shingling: Tokenizes a buffer into overlapping shingles
    having a specified width, as measured by character count. For example, the
    3-shingles for "mouse" are {"mou", "ous", "use"}.

    If the buffer is shorter than the shingle width then this produces a single
    shorter-than-usual shingle.

    The current implementation is simplistic and not whitespace- or punctuation-aware,
    and doesn't treat the beginning or end of the buffer in any special way.

    Character-level shingles are also called "k-grams", and can be used for various
    kinds of tolerant string matching, or near-duplicate detection. For details, see
    https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/k-gram-indexes-for-wildcard-queries-1.html,

    or https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/near-duplicates-and-shingling-1.html.

    Note that 1-shingles reduces to a simple unigram tokenizer.

    with the added convenience of doing normalization as part of the tokenization process.
